## Simple CRUD Application

In this project I wanted to create a simple CRUD application using SQLite3. CRUD is an acronym that means (CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE) operations. These operations are used to manipulate, read, insert, delete and edit data. When developing in SQL it is very important to know how each operation works.

For the application, I placed each operation in it's own Python file so the workflow could be of ease to understand. The concepts of each operation is performed in the corrected python file of choice.

Benefits of CRUD offers the following: 
- Facilitates security control by satisfying the various access requirements
- Simplifies and facilitates application design make it more scalable.
- Has better perforamnce compared to ad-hoc SQL statements
